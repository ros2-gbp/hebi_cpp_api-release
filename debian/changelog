ros-rolling-hebi-cpp-api (3.13.0-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Add non-const Group and EndEffector getters to Arm class, and Group getters to EndEffector class
  * Added Arm.setEndEffector function to allow explicitly adding an end effector to an Arm object after construction
  * Improved joint limit objective function stability/behavior; C++ API now has additional tuning parameter to control edge behavior
  * Added time heuristic functions for choosing waypoint times (also exposed in C++ API along with trajectory time conversion methods)
  * Unicast addresses can be passed into the hebiLookup object in addition to broadcast interfaces
  * Added RobotModel.getMaxSpeeds and .getMaxEfforts functions to get max speeds and efforts for DoFs
  * Added Group.logUserState function to write a timestamped UserState event directly to the log file (can be viewed in Scope plots)
  * Added Trajectory.getMinMaxPosition, getMaxVelocity, and getMaxAcceleration functions to get extrema of the trajectory without needing to sample
  * Update CMake minimum version to 3.10 to avoid compatibility/deprecation warnings on more recent versions
  * Support v1.1 of the [HEBI robot config format](https://github.com/hebirobotics/robot-config), adding command lifetime and feedback frequency parameters to the config file
  * add enums for T-5/8 and R/T-25 actuators and accessories.  These are used with functional RobotModel construction methods as well as getting RobotModel metadata
  * Update C API to v2.20
  * Suppressed uninitialized member warnings

ros-rolling-hebi-cpp-api (3.10.0-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Features/Changes:
    * add dynamics comp + doubled joint plugins
    * add getters/setters for impedance control plugin
    * use doubles instead of floats in arm plugins (minor change in experimental arm class)
    * parse "user data" values as same parameter types as for plugins instead of saving as strings (minor change in experimental arm class)
    * store absolute path for robot config file withing RobotConfig structure
    * try to load/set default gains when creating arm from config
    * update C API to 2.15.0 from 2.13.0
    * provides ubuntu 20.04 compatibility again
    * adds support for debug symbols in win X64 build
    * lookup searches localhost by default to work with private imitation groups from Scope
    * multiple log files per second now supported when using default file name (note -- naming convention changed from hh.mm.ss to hh-mm-ss.ms to match MATLAB API convention)
    * prevent certain large info messages returned from modules from getting dropped
    * added control strategy 5 to ControlStrategy enum
    * update minimum required CMake to 3.5 to reduce cmake warnings from newer versions
    * added helpers to optionally create Arm and MobileIO objects using an existing Lookup object
    * access "Runtime Data" in "Extra" info packets, including number of seconds a module has been on and/or commanded. Note -- requires firmware support, and count will only include time for module since first updating to firmware with this feature.
    * MobileIO class now has "sendLayout" and "sendLayoutBuffer" functions, allowing layout configurations to be sent to MobileIO devices
  * Bugfixes:
    * added const attribute for a number of getters
    * small refactoring for readability, minor cleanup and formatting
    * update calls for C IK functions from internally deprecated ones to equivalent new ones
    * address a number of compiler warnings, while making warning checking more strict for GCC and clang
    * ignore warnings given by included Eigen library

ros-rolling-hebi-cpp-api (3.1.0-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Reduce conversion needs by adding (deprecated) overloads for:
    
      * getJ
      * getJacobians
      * getFK
      * getForwardKinematics
      * getFrameCount
    
  * Fix multiple definition error
  (from 3.0.0)
  * Robot Model:
    
      * Added "input frame" type for forward kinematics operations
      * Added end effector support (custom and parallel gripper types)
      * Added R-series support (actuator, link, bracket, and end effector)
      * Added options for link input + output type
      * Support import of HRDF format 1.2.0
    
  * Robot Model:
    
      * removed "combine" functionality for addJoint and addRigidBody
      * now only allows addition of elements which match the physical interface of the previous element
      * changed the behavior of "end effector" frames; by default, none are returned any unless an "end effector" is specifically added
      * Changed usages of HebiJointType, HebiFrameType, and HebiRobotModelElementType C-style enums to C++ scoped enums
    
  * Fixed bug when setting IO pins in commands; commands would sometimes affect other pins.
  (from 2.2.0)
  * Added ability to set and clear text in the experimental mobile IO API
  * Added ability to get raw feedback from experimental mobile IO API

ros-rolling-hebi-cpp-api (2.0.2-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Make package installable
  * Moved the header files into an include directory
  * Removed the Eigen folder; use ROS package instead
  * Fixed CMake for installable package
    
      * Addressed Eigen dependency
      * Installed include files and libraries correctly
    
  * NOTE: this does not correspond with an official 2.0.2
    release of the upstream HEBI C++ API, because these
    changes were all local ROS build system changes. This
    mismatch will be resolved in v2.1.0.
